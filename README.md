👋 Hi, I’m @LeoPyzhov.<br>
👀 I'm interested in IT in general, aiming to become a versatile Java developer in the future.<br>
🌱 I'm currently learning Java.<br>
💞️ I'm just starting out and am open to collaborating with any company in need of a Java developer.<br>

😄 My pronouns are AH-64 Apache.<br>
⚡ Fun fact: I lead a very active life: attending school, hitting the gym, swimming, and for the past four years, I've been professionally involved in athletics in Ukraine, even competing in the national championship and securing the 30th position. Now i'm living in Germany.
